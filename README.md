# Power-Inductor-Tester

This is a trivial power inductor tester - PIT

It is essential to understand the inductor saturation current and the voltage and ESR behavior.

General low voltage LRC meter cannot easily measured.

This front-end tester need an oscilloscope to measure the ramp, so any low frequency or low price DSO can do the work perfectly.
